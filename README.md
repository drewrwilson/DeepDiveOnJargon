# Use all of the jargon

Record any of the strange things you've heard around the office which we may have initially suspected aren't actually real words.


## How to contribute
1. Edit the `words.csv` file with one word or phrase per line  
   * enter jargon as the first value
   * bonus points for adding additional comma-separated variations corresponding to parts of speech  
   * for example:  
   `JARGON,verb - present,noun,adjective,phrase,proper noun`  
   `Adopt-a-Hydrant,,,,,Adopt-a-Hydrant`  
   `disruption,disrupt,disruption,disruptive,,`
2. You're done
